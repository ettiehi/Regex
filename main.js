// It isn't just one of your holiday games;

// You may think at first I'm as mad as a hatter

// When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.

// First of all, there's the name that the family use daily,

// Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo or James,

// Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey—

// All of them sensible everyday names.

// There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,

// Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames:

// Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter—

// But all of them sensible everyday names.

// But I tell you, a cat needs a name that's particular,

// A name that's peculiar, and more dignified,

// Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular,

// Or spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride?`;
